##### What I Noticed #####

Found incorrect end of sentences:
1: After punctuation within numbers
2: After punctuation within a quote
3. Included newline characters as part of sentences
3: After name abbreviations (i.e M. Keflezighi)
4: After month abbreviations (i.e Nov. 5 Victory)

##### Plan to change #####

1. All end of sentence punctuation characters should be immediately followed by whitespace. By adding this
   I should be able to remove all errors with numbers such as "26.2 mile race", "2:26:53" and "100,000.00"
2. One exception to the rule I wrote above is if the sentence ends in quotes. So I'm gonna add a ".\"" in
   the sentence punctuation list
3. Another exception is when punctuation characters are followed by newlines so I plan to include that
4. For now I'm handling name abbreviations by checking for a capital letter followed by a period, I think that
   is the only case which those characters occur in sequences but I could be wrong
5. For months I created a list of month abbreviations and check if current string of chars is in it
